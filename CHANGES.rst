-------------------
Hotfix

- packaging failure under python2
- better README

v4.2.0 (2016-06-10)
-------------------

v4.2 Announcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Bye bye Python 2 ! This 4.2 branch will be the last to support Python 2. We will maintain bug fixes on it for at least
  the end of 2016 so you can transition nicely, but please start now !

  Python 3 has been released 8 years ago, now all the major distributions finally have it available, the ecosystem has
  moved on too. This was not the case at all when we started to port Errbot to Python 3.

  This will clean up *a lot* of code with ugly `if PY2`, unicode hacks, 3to2 reverse hacks all over the place and
  packaging tricks.
  But most of all it will finally unite the Errbot ecosystem under one language and open up new possibilities as we
  refrained from using py3 only features.

- A clarification on Errbot's license has been accepted. The contributors never intended to have the GPL licence
  be enforced for external plugins. Even if it was not clear it would apply, our new licence exception makes sure
  it isn't.
  Big big thanks for the amazing turnout on this one !


v4.2 New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Errbot initial installation. The initial installation has been drastically simplified::

    $ pip install errbot
    $ mkdir errbot; cd errbot
    $ errbot --init
    $ errbot -T
    >>>     <- You are game !!

  Not only that but it also install a development directory in there so it now takes only seconds to have an Errbot
  development environment.

- Part of this change, we also made most of the config.py entries with sane defaults, a lot of those settings were
  not even relevant for most users.

- cards are now supported on the graphic backend with a nice rendering (errbot -G)

- Hipchat: mentions are now supported.


v4.2 Miscellaneous changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Documentation improvements
- Reorganization and rename of the startup files. Those were historically the first ones to be created and their meaning
  drifted over the years. We had err.py, main.py and errBot.py, it was really not clear what were their functions and
  why one has been violating the python module naming convention for so long :)
  They are now bootstrap.py (everything about configuring errbot), cli.py (everything about the errbot command line)
  and finally core.py (everything about the commands, and dispatching etc...).
- setup.py cleanup. The hacks in there were incorrect.

v4.2 fixes
~~~~~~~~~~

- core: excpetion formatting was failing on some plugin load failures.
- core: When replacing the prefix `!` from the doctrings only real commands get replaced (thx Raphael Boidol)
- core: empty lines on plugins requirements.txt does crash errbot anymore
- core: Better error message in case of malformed .plug file
- Text: fix on build_identifier (thx Pawet Adamcak)
- Slack: several fixes for identifiers parsing, the backend is fully compliant with Errbot's
  contract now (thx Raphael Boidol and Samuel Loretan)
- Hipchat: fix on room occupants (thx Roman Forkosh)
- Hipchat: fix for organizations with more than 100 rooms. (thx Naman Bharadwaj)
- Hipchat: fixed a crash on build_identifier

v4.1.3 (2016-05-10)
-------------------

hotfixes:

- Slack: regression on build_identifier
- Hipchat: regression on build_identifier (query for room is not supported)

v4.1.2 (2016-05-10)
-------------------

fixes:

- cards for hipchat and slack were not merged.

v4.1.1 (2016-05-09)
-------------------

fixes:

- Python 2.7 conversion error on err.py.

v4.1.0 (2016-05-09)
-------------------

v4.1 features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Conversation flows: Errbot can now keep track of conversations with its users and
  automate part of the interactions in a state machine manageable from chat.
  see `the flows documentation <http://errbot.io/en/master/user_guide/flow_development/index.html>`_
  for more information.

- Cards API: Various backends have a "canned" type of formatted response.
  We now support that for a better native integration with Slack and Hipchat.

- Dynamic Plugins API: Errbot has now an official API to build plugins at runtime (on the fly).
  see `the dynamic plugins doc <http://errbot.io/en/master/user_guide/plugin_development/dynaplugs.html>`_

- Storage command line interface: It is now possible to provision any persistent setting from the command line.
  It is helpful if you want to automate end to end the deployment of your chatbot.
  see `provisioning doc <http://errbot.io/en/master/user_guide/provisioning.html>`_

v4.1 Miscellaneous changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Now if no [python] section is set in the .plug file, we assume Python 3 instead of Python 2.
- Slack: identifier.person now gives its username instead of slack id
- IRC: Topic change callback fixed. Thx Ezequiel Brizuela.
- Text/Test: Makes the identifier behave more like a real backend.
- Text: new TEXT_DEMO_MODE that removes the logs once the chat is started: it is made for presentations / demos.
- XMPP: build_identifier can now resolve a Room (it will eventually be available on other backends)
- Graphic Test backend: renders way better the chat, TEXT_DEMO_MODE makes it full screen for your presentations.
- ACLs: We now allow a simple string as an entry with only one element.
- Unit Tests are now all pure py.test instead of a mix of (py.test, nose and unittest)

v4.1 fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

v4.0.0 (2016-03-13)
-------------------

This is the next major release of errbot with significant changes under the hood.


v4.0 New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Storage is now implemented as a plugin as well, similar to command plugins and backends.
  This means you can now select different storage implementations or even write your own.

The following storage backends are currently available:

  + The traditional Python `shelf` storage.
  + In-memory storage for tests or ephemeral storage.
  + `SQL storage <https://github.com/errbotio/err-storage-sql>`_ which supports relational databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Redshift etc.
  + `Firebase storage <https://github.com/errbotio/err-storage-firebase>`_ for the Google Firebase DB.
  + `Redis storage <https://github.com/errbotio/err-storage-redis>`_ (thanks Sijis Aviles!) which uses the Redis in-memory data structure store.

- Unix-style glob support in `BOT_ADMINS` and `ACCESS_CONTROLS` (see the updated `config-template.py` for documentation).

- The ability to apply ACLs to all commands exposed by a plugin (see the updated `config-template.py` for documentation).

- The mention_callcack() on IRC (mr. Shu).

- A new (externally maintained) `Skype backend <https://github.com/errbotio/errbot-backend-skype>`_.

- The ability to disable core plugins (such as `!help`, `!status`, etc) from loading (see `CORE_PLUGINS` in the updated `config-template.py`).

- Added a `--new-plugin` flag to `errbot` which can create an emply plugin skeleton for you.

- IPv6 configuration support on IRC (Mike Burke)

- More flexible access controls on IRC based on nickmasks (in part thanks to Marcus Carlsson).
  IRC users, see the new `IRC_ACL_PATTERN` in `config-template.py`.

- A new `callback_mention()` for plugins (not available on all backends).

- Admins are now notified about plugin startup errors which happen during bot startup

- The repos listed by the `!repos` command are now fetched from a public index and can be
  queried with `!repos query [keyword]`. Additionally, it is now possible to add your own
  index(es) to this list as well in case you wish to maintain a private index (special
  thanks to Sijis Aviles for the initial proof-of-concept implementation).


v4.0 fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- IRC backend no longer crashes on invalid UTF-8 characters but instead replaces
  them (mr. Shu).

- Fixed joining password-protected rooms (Mikko Lehto)

- Compatibility to API changes introduced in slackclient-1.0.0 (used by the Slack backend).

- Corrected room joining on IRC (Ezequiel Hector Brizuela).

- Fixed *"team_join event handler raised an exception"* on Slack.

- Fixed `DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE` on HipChat.

- Fixed `DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE` on Slack.

- Fixed `GROUPCHAT_NICK_PREFIXED` not prefixing the user on regular commands.

- Fixed `HIDE_RESTRICTED_ACCESS` from accidentally sending messages when issuing `!help`.

- Fixed `DIVERT_TO_PRIVATE` on IRC.

- Fixed markdown rendering breaking with `GROUPCHAT_NICK_PREFIXED` enabled.

- Fixed `AttributeError` with `AUTOINSTALL_DEPS` enabled.

- IRC backend now cleanly disconnects from IRC servers instead of just cutting the connection.

- Text mode now displays the prompt beneath the log output

- Plugins which fail to install no longer remain behind, obstructing a new installation attempt


v4.0 Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The underlying implementation of Identifiers has been drastically refactored
  to be more clear and correct. This makes it a lot easier to construct Identifiers
  and send messages to specific people or rooms.

- The file format for `--backup` and `--restore` has changed between 3.x and 4.0
  On the v3.2 branch, backup can now backup using the new v4 format with `!backupv4` to
  make it possible to use with `--restore` on errbot 4.0.

A number of features which had previously been deprecated have now been removed.
These include:

- `configure_room` and `invite_in_room` in `XMPPBackend` (use the
  equivalent functions on the `XMPPRoom` object instead)

- The `--xmpp`, `--hipchat`, `--slack` and `--irc` command-line options
  from `errbot` (set a proper `BACKEND` in `config.py` instead).


v 4.0 Miscellaneous changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Version information is now specified in plugin `.plug` files instead of in
  the Python class of the plugin.

- Updated `!help` output, more similar to Hubot's help output (James O'Beirne and Sijis Aviles).

- XHTML-IM output can now be enabled on XMPP again.

- New `--version` flag on `errbot` (mr. Shu).

- Made `!log tail` admin only (Nicolas Sebrecht).

- Made the version checker asynchronous, improving startup times.

- Optionally allow bot configuration from groupchat

- `Message.type` is now deprecated in favor of `Message.is_direct` and `Message.is_group`.

- Some bundled dependencies have been refactored out into external dependencies.

- Many improvements have been made to the documention, both in docstrings internally as well
  as the user guide on the website at http://errbot.io.


Further info on identifier changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Person, RoomOccupant and Room are now all equal and can be used as-is to send a message
  to a person, a person in a Room or a Room itself.

The relationship is as follow:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/errbotio/errbot/master/docs/_static/arch/identifiers.png
   :target: https://github.com/errbotio/errbot/blob/master/errbot/backends/base.py

For example: A Message sent from a room will have a RoomOccupant as frm and a Room as to.

This means that you can now do things like:

- `self.send(msg.frm, "Message")`
- `self.send(self.query_room("#general"), "Hello everyone")`



.. v9.9.9 (leave that there so master doesn't complain)
